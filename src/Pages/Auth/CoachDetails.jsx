                I recently just moved to Joplin, MO after finishing two years of
                coaching at Poudre High School in Fort Collins, CO, coaching the
                varsity quarterbacks. I am also actively coaching athletes in
                individual sessions, as well as coaching multiple flag football
                teams in the offseason. At Lehigh, I helped younger quarterbacks
                and teammates transition from the high school game to Division 1
                competition (e.g. learning new offensive schemes/game plans,
                reading defenses, fundamentals, and more). I coached a family
                friend who played quarterback at the high school level while at
                Lehigh. I have had over 10 years of experience playing the
                position under top tier quarterback coaches (currently a
                Division 1AA head coach & Division 1AA OC, both with excellent
                careers themselves). I am really excited to coach football
                players of all ages!
