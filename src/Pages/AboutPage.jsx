                  In the summer of 2021, our CEO played pickleball for the first
                  time. Over the next few years, his love for the game has only
                  grown. We want the same love we have for pickleball to spread
                  to as many people as possible, and for people to enjoy this
                  amazing sport while continuing to improve at it. Become a
                  coach, or book a session as an athlete and become a part of
                  the fastest growing sport in America!
